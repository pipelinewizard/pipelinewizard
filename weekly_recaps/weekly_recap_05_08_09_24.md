Week 5 of Learning Data Engineering in Public: Here is what I learned this week.

1. Connecting to PGadmin: In order to connect your PostgreSQL server to PGadmin you need to start said PostgreSQL server first before connecting.

2. Note-Taking: It is challenging at first to get into the habit of taking notes while working through a session, or even after a session for that matter, but the best engineers make this a habit.

3. Checking IP Address in Bash: How to check the IP address of your machine in bash - "ip addr show eth0"

Week 5: Starting to get into a groove:

I'm still working on the NYC taxicab dataset, and I've gotten to point where I can start thinking about aggregation tables. Fact and dimension tables have been transformed and modeled. I'm writing a decent amount of SQL queries and bash commands without looking them up, and it's starting to feel more natural.
