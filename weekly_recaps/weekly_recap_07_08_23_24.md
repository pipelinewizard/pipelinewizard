Week 7 of Learning Data Engineering in Public - Here's What I Learned This Week.

1. When performing a `DROP COLUMN` command in SQL, you do not need to include the data type. This is different from the `ADD COLUMN` command, where you do have to specify the data type.

2. There isn't a consensus on whether KPIs should be handled in the database or in the BI tool. I had many conversations this week on my stream and other socials with members of the Data Engineering community, and I received a lot of different answers.

3. My knowledge of Git commands is basically nonexistent. Once set up in VS Code, you can use the interface to push your local repository to the remote repository. However, I’ve read that knowing Git commands is extremely useful, so this is something I will need to work on. I did learn about squash rebase, which consolidates commits, and I think that’s pretty cool.

I can’t believe it’s already Week 7 of Learning Data Engineering in Public. I’m still working on the NYC taxicab dataset, and as of today, I think I might be wrapping up the transformation stage of the Data Engineering lifecycle (though I might eat my words next week). I’m currently dealing with a Git issue. Since I didn’t update the .gitignore file, I have a local commit with about 8,000 files hanging in the queue 😂, so I’ll be working through that next week.

I'll be live on Twitch Monday through Friday from 6-9am PT.

If you are beginning your data engineering journey like me, drop in and we can commiserate together 🧑🏾‍💻

If you are a more seasoned data engineer with experience under your belt, drop in and flex your teaching muscle a bit. 💪🏿--Everybody (mostly me) would really appreciate it!

Happy Friday!
