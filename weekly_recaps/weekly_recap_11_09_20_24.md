Week 11 of Learning Data Engineering in Public: Hereâ€™s What I Learned This Week



1. Git Commands - Rename Branch:



I renamed my local branch from 'master' to 'main' to match GitHub's default branch.



To rename your local Git branch, you can do it in two ways:

1. Rename current branch: git branch -m new_branch_name

2. Rename another branch: git branch -m old_branch_name new_branch_name



2. Git Sub Modules:



I thought consolidating all my repositories into one parent repository using Git submodules would make things simpler. I was wrong. I assumed commits made to the child repositories would automatically update in the parent repository, but that wasnâ€™t the case. After every commit and push to a child repo, I had to manually update, commit and push in the parent repo ðŸ˜”



To update a submodule in a parent repo: 'git submodule update --remote'



3. Github Profile README:



After deciding not to use submodules to organize my repos, someone on my stream suggested using a GitHub Profile README instead. GitHub has a feature where if you create a repository with the same name as your username, you can add a README that displays on your profile's homepage.

NYC Taxicab Project Update:



I'm still in the transformation stage with the NYC Taxicab dataset. This week, I worked on creating daily, weekly, and monthly summary tables for location data (e.g., daily_summary_by_end_city, monthly_summary_by_start_borough). The goal is to avoid loading the full 14 million-row parquet table into a BI tool by optimizing the process with these summary tables.



Recap:



I was able to study and stream 5/5 days this week, making significant progress. I focused on updating systems and getting closer to the serving phase of the first iteration of the NYC taxicab pipeline. However, I didnâ€™t get to read as much as Iâ€™d hoped. To address this, I started listening to Martin Kleppmann lectures on distributed systems on YouTube a few nights this week.



Reading & Resources:



I'm currently reading Designing Data-Intensive Applications by Martin Kelppmann, this week I read about bitmapping and run-length encoding which are techniques for compressing large tables to optimize indexing.



Next Week's Goals:



Next week, I aim to officially complete the transformation stage for the first iteration of the NYC taxicab dataset. I'm also planning to publish my first article on Substack. While Iâ€™ve been consistently posting my notes from working sessions, I think it's time to start consolidating my learning.



Just one week shy of three months of learning data engineering in public! â€”LET'S GO!



Have a great weekend, everyone!



Follow along with my learning journey and join me live as I work through data engineering challenges and projects. I stream every weekday morning â€“ feel free to drop by, ask questions, and share your thoughts!
