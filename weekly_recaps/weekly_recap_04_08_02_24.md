Week 4 of Learning Data Engineering in Public: This what I learned this week.

1. Consistency is Key
As long as I stay consistent in my study, I'm moving in the right direction. Sometimes I get caught up in trying to optimize my study sessions -- finding the best resources or using the best tools -- but by being consistent these things should take care of themself

2. Documenting is Essential
I need to document what I'm learning - I had to look up how to start the PostgreSQL database 3 days in a row. I should probably write it down lol.

3. Building Community is Invaluable.
The number of people who have reached out to me to offer advice or share their journey into Data Engineering has been absolutely amazing.

For example, during my Twitch stream, one person literally walked me through setting up my Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) and a virtual environment in VS code to store my NYC Taxicab project.

It has been a great month of Learning Data Engineering in Public!

If you really want to see what it looks like to start from the bottom in real time drop by my stream. I'm on Mon - Fri 6am - 9am PT
