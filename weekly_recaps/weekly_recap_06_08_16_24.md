Week 6 of Learning Data Engineering in Public: This is what I learned this week.

1. SQL File Organization: I asked the data engineering community the best way to organize their SQL query files, and the consensus was... there was no consensus! Everyone had a different approach. However, one common piece of advice stood out: the more granular your file organization, the easier it will be to update queries or handle schema changes.

2. JOIN in SQL = MERGE in Power BI: I begin working with Power BI in 2022, but I mostly dealt with CSV/Excel files or data pulled from APIs. Somehow, I never made the connection that JOIN in SQL is equivalent to MERGE in Power BI - until now. It's a simple but important realization.

3. Python Parameters vs. Arguments: Thanks to a generous individual on my Twitch stream Tuesday morning, I learned that parameters are placeholders for arguments, and arguments are the actual values that replace those placeholders. ðŸ¤¯

This week felt like a big step forward. I created a new note-taking template for my work sessions, that has really helped me focus. It includes sections for "Goals for the day", "Blockers Encountered", and "Progress Summaries", it's like a personal daily stand-up.

To keep myself accountable, I started posting these notes on my Substack every morning, creating a running log of my progress. I'm still in the transformation stage with the NYC Taxicab dataset, and I hit a roadblock this morning while trying to create a weekly aggregation table using a JOIN statement. I'll be diving back into this on Monday morning.

Stay Tuned!
