Week 2 of Learning Data Engineering in Public. This is what I learned:

1. Narrating your learning process is an under-rated technique that goes along way: Someone suggested buying a rubber duck to put on my desk, so I don't feel like I'm talking to myself ðŸ˜‚ ðŸ¦†

2. Funny enough, things start to make sense if you start from the beginning: This week I started diving into the Python tutorials on Pythons official website and it feels awesome to watch the terminal respond.

3. Just run it locally before you worry about the cloud: I was dead set on using cloud technology, because I was aware of cloud technology - but since I am still working on the fundamentals of Data Engineering, it is currently not necessary.
