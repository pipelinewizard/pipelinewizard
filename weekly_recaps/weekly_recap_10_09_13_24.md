Week 10 of Learning Data Engineering in Public: Here is what I learned this Week.

1. Null Values:

When working with NULL values in SQL, you can't set a value
using value = NULL. Instead, you have to use value IS NULL. This detail drove me crazy, but I eventually figured it out!

2. PostgreSQL Limits:

I have a Parquet table with 14 million rows, but when I ran SELECT COUNT(*) FROM nyctaxicab_2009_01, PostgreSQL only showed 10,000 rows. This is very odd behavior, and Iâ€™m not entirely sure how or why this happens. I'll need to investigate this further next week.

3. Next Project Idea:

I had a meeting with Jacob Wilson regarding my goals and my next project idea, and surprisingly, I realized I don't have a strong passion for NYC taxicab data... But I do have a deep passion for music. He suggested I steer my next project in that direction, and Iâ€™m excited to start planning!

Recap:

This week, I was only able to study/stream 2 out of 5 days. My 9-month-old daughter has been under the weather and hasn't been sleeping well. Despite this, I continued learning even when I couldnâ€™t actively work on my NYC taxicab project.

At the start of this journey, I was reading The Fundamentals of Data Engineering by Joe Reis ðŸ¤“ If you haven't read it and are interested in data engineering, itâ€™s an excellent introduction. 

Currently, I'm reading Designing Data-Intensive Applications by Martin Kleppmann, and it feels like the difficulty level has ramped up significantly! A lot of the concepts are above my current level, but Iâ€™m making a point to note down what I donâ€™t understand and look them up when I can.
Iâ€™m hoping next week will allow for more consistency with streaming my study sessions on Twitch.

Hope everyone has a great weekend!
