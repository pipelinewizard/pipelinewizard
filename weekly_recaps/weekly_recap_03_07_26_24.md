Week 3 of Learning Data Engineering in Public: Here is what I learned this week.

1. Watching the terminal print the NYC Taxicab data frame was more satisfying that I anticipated.

2. Watching that same terminal get hung up and not load the data frame into the PostGreSQL database was more maddening than I anticipated ðŸ˜‚

3. I am now starting to understand the beauty of distributed computing and RAM. Can't believe I have been taken them for granted for so long.

I'll be back at it again on Monday Morning if anyone wants to stop by - maybe I'll actually get the df loaded!
