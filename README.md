# **Learning Data Engineering in Public**

## **Project Overview**

Learning Data Engineering in Public is an initiative dedicated to openly documenting my journey of learning data engineering from scratch. This initiative is committed to transparency and aims to support others in their learning journey by sharing every step of the process.

## **Objectives**

*Transparency*: To provide an honest and detailed account of my learning process, including successes and challenges.

*Education*: To offer valuable insights, tips, and resources that can help others who are also learning data engineering.

*Community Engagement*: To build and engage with a community of learners, professionals, and enthusiasts in the data engineering field.

## **Core Components**

*Long-Form Video Content:*

[Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/pipelinewizard): I livestream my study sessions, data engineering projects, and interviews with data professionals in real time.

[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@pipeline_wizard): I upload my Twitch streams and additional long-form content such as interviews and project updates.

*Short-Form Video Content:*

[TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@pipelinewizard), [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/pipelinewizard/), and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/isaiahdonley/): Quick tips, insights, and updates on data engineering are shared across these platforms to provide bite-sized, actionable information.

*Written Content:*

[Substack](https://learningdataengineeringinpublic.substack.com/?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=substack_profile)/[Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/isaiahdonley/): I share in-depth notes and reflections on my data engineering journey, with daily updates in the Daily Log, detailed insights in Pipeline Chronicles, and comprehensive summaries of each project, in Project Reviews.

*Skill Development:*

[GitHub](https://github.com/pipelinewizard): Explore my projects.

[leetcode](https://leetcode.com/u/pipelinewizard/): Follow my progress on coding challenges that enhance problem-solving skills.

## **Goals**

To Document: Capture and share the complete learning journey in data engineering.

To Educate: Provide valuable resources and insights for fellow learners.

To Connect: Build a supportive and engaged community around data engineering.

## **Get Involved**
